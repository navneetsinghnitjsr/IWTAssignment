<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: square;">An unordered list can be specified with the tags ul and /ul <br>
	<li style="list-style-type: square;">An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified
with tags li and /li. <br>
<li style="list-style-type: square;">After you have created your unordered list,<br>check out what happens when you
convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags ul and /ul with ol and
/ol, respectively.<br></ol>
<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet</li></ul></a><br>

	another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the<br>

Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse<br>
cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in<br>
the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is<br>
over the link.</a><br>
