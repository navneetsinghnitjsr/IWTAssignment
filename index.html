	<p> <b>Question 1:</b>
<a href="#Question1TableTag.html">1. Create a static webpage using table tags of HTML.</a>
		
2. Create a static web page which defines all text formatting tags of HTML in tabular format.<br>
3. Create a webpage using list tags of HTML.<br>
4. Create webpage to include image using HTML tag.	<br>
5. Create employee registration webpage using HTML form objects.<br>
6. Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains a heading and two
paragraphs of text. <br>Use the HTML tags h1 Tag,paragraph Tag and in this exercise. As the texts in the
heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like.<br>
<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type: disc;";>Add an unordered list to this web page. An unordered list should look like the following when it is shown by a browser:<br>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: square;">An unordered list can be specified with the tags ul and /ul <br>
	<li style="list-style-type: square;">An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified
with tags li and /li. <br>
<li style="list-style-type: square;">After you have created your unordered list,<br>check out what happens when you
convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags ul and /ul with ol and
/ol, respectively.<br></ol>
<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet</li><br>
</ul>
7.Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new<br>
file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After you<br>
have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load<br>
another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the<br>
<a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a href attribute that specifies<br>
which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.<br><br><br>
8. HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the <a> tag.<br>
Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse<br>
cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in<br>
the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is<br>
over the link.<br>
<br><br>
9. It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the picture that is on your<br>
page will also serve as a link that leads to another page.<br><br>
10. Upload your two .html files to a server and test that they work as real internet pages.<br>
<br><br><br>
11. Design a website for a College. There should be at least 15 web-pages present in the web-site. There
should be:<br>

about the course, a list of all the teachers taking the course and the timetable for that particular
subject.
<li style="list-style-type: square;">The Admission page basically contains a form that a student needs to fill up in order to take
