        <p> JMehtab Bagh is a charbagh garden complex and one of the last Mughal gardens in Agra. It is located just north to the Taj Mahal and overlooks the Agra Fort and Yamuna river on the opposite side. Perfectly aligned with the gardens of Taj Mahal, Mehtab Bagh provides a picture-perfect view of the Taj from the fountain at the front of the entrance gate. It is a popular sunset spot among the photography fanatics and nature enthusiasts. </p> <br>

        <p>   The splendid Mehtab Bagh has four sandstone towers, one each at the corner with a huge octagonal tank right in the centre. It is believed that Shah Jahan especially got the bagh designed for his personal interests so he could come up here and admire the infinite beauty of Taj Mahal. On the moonlit nights, the clear reflection of the wondrous Taj Mahal in the waters of the park is a sight beyond description. Mehtabh Bagh is now a horticulture delight with scores of vibrantly blooming floral plants and medicinal herbs, besides the umpteen fruit trees, which add to the beauty of the park.</p> <br>

        <h3 style="color: #ddf709;">Historical Significance :</h3>  
        Initially built in 1530 by the Mughal Emperor Babur, the striking Mehtab Bagh fell into disrepair until Shah Jahan identified it as the perfect viewing spot for the Taj Mahal and stepped up to soak in its beauty. It was then removed from the floodplains and stack of filth and converted into a “moonlit pleasure garden” in the Persian - style layout with plastered pavilions elevated walkways, ornamental fountains and pretty pools. By the early 1900s, frequent flooding and misuse of the resources reduced the once enchanting garden to an enormous pile of sand with overgrowth of weed and wild plants. </p>
        
      <p>  In 1994, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) surveyed the site and carried out detailed research to get to the verity about the rumoured Black Taj Mahal only to find it was a myth. Rather, the excavations unearthed an octagonal tank, 25 water fountains and a four - complex divided compartment, all suggesting the possibility of a well-established garden at the site. Later, the discovery of a letter by Aurangzeb to Shah Jahan in 1652 AD, referring to the condition of Mehtab Bagh during flood events further verify the authenticity. Today, ASI is making efforts to restore the charming spot to its original state. The imposing Mehtab Bagh is already on its way to recovery with numerous trees of citrus, guava and hibiscus, and brightly blooming seasonal flowers. </p><br>

        <h3 style="color: #ddf709;">How to Reach Mehtab Bagh </h3>Located at a distance of barely 7-8 kms from the Taj Mahal complex in the heart of the city, the garden can be easily reached through local electric/ battery operated rickshaws. You can also hire auto-rickshaws to reach the park. The city is also well connected through state-run buses which you can avail. Alternatively, you can book taxi cabs from anywhere in the city. Recently, the management has also come up with the option of the ferry ride from the eastern side of the Taj to across here.</p>
