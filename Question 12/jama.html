        <p> Jama Masjid at Agra also known as 'Friday Mosque' is a seventeenth-century structure and is one of the largest mosques built by the Mughals in India. Constructed under the reign of Shah Jahan in 1648, Jama Masjid is dedicated to his favourite daughter Jahan Ara Begum. This splendid monument is visible from the Agra Fort with the Agra Fort Railway station right between the two structures. </p> <br>

        <p>    The Jama Masjid is built mainly of red sandstone and white marble that stand as a testimony to the magnificent Mughal architecture. It has a fountain at the centre and is supported by four kiosks in the courtyard. The interior walls have scriptures in the Persian style praising for Shah Jahan and Jahan Ara. The inlaid panels of work here are quite similar to that of Taj Mahal and are common to all the monuments and structures built by the Mughals in Agra. Every Friday, special prayers are conducted at this mosque which is attended by thousands of devotees. The Tomb of Salim Chisti is a part of the mosque compound.</p> <br>

        <h3 style="color: #ddf709;">History of Jama Masjid</h3>  
        The Jama Masjid was built by Shah Jahan for his favourite daughter Jahan Ara Begum. Its construction began in 1648 and took six years to complete with the efforts of five thousand workers. The mosque had a large open area in its front, known as the Tripoli Chowk. This octagonal chowk existed between Jama Masjid and the Delhi Gate of Agra Fort. However, this Chowk was destroyed during 1871-1873, to give room to Agra Fort Railway Station. The gateway otherwise known as the "Buland Darwaza" to the mosque was added after Shah Jahan's comprehensive victory in the Kandesh military campaign. A lot of the engravings are in Persian. </p><br>
